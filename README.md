# About

Say hello to LIRI!

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, 
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that 
takes in parameters and gives you back data.

This LIRI app uses the Twitter API, Spotify API, and OMDB API to grab information requested by the user.
LIRI takes in four commands;

'concert-this',
'spotify-this-song',
'movie-this',
'do-what-it-says'.
